# bazar
This is a sandbox playground for my [niva](https://github.com/gavr123456789/Niva) language  

## Bindings
Collection of bindings files to java\kotlin libraries.  
Just put such file in your niva project and you are ready to use it, since niva doesn't require any imports or project configuration.  

## Examples
This is just a dump from various experiments, some of them are useful like http4kserver.  
Some are not very good, but this is a great place to look at the examples on niva.

## Programs
Real programs, not used for a long time, the only real thing there is [learnGreekCli](https://github.com/gavr123456789/bazar/blob/main/Programs/learnGreekCli/main.niva), but there are a gui version [AdwLearnGreek](https://github.com/gavr123456789/bazar/blob/main/Examples/GTK/AdwLearnGreek/main.niva) so its kinda depricated.  

### bazar itself
